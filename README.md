# Employee Retention Prediction and Recommendations
  **Introduction:**
  
   This project focuses on analyzing and predicting employee attrition using machine learning 
  techniques. The goal is to identify key factors contributing to employee turnover and provide data-driven 
  recommendations to improve retention.
 
**Goal:**
    The project aims to use machine learning models to predict employees at risk of leaving and provide 
   strategic retention plans based on data insights. It also aims to optimize HR policies to reduce turnover.
    
**Description:**

   The project involves analyzing employee data to uncover key trends, identifying high-risk employees, and 
   implementing predictive models to forecast attrition.
    
 **Key Metrics:** Salary, job satisfaction, work-life balance, commute distance, tenure, promotions, and 
                training opportunities.
 **Techniques:** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify patterns, correlations, and retention risk 
                factors.
 **Modeling:** Machine learning (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, XGBoost) to predict employee attrition.
 **Challenges:** Class imbalance in attrition prediction and need for feature engineering to improve model 
                accuracy.
     
**Skills:**

  - **Data Analysis:** EDA, correlation analysis, and employee segmentation.
  - **Machine Learning:** Classification models, feature engineering, and class imbalance handling.
  - **Programming:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn).
  - **Visualization:**  Interactive dashboards for HR insights using Tableau or Power BI.
    
**Data Description**

Key Columns:
Employee_ID: Unique identifier for each employee.
Age: Age of the employee.
Department: The department in which the employee works.
Job Role: Specific role in the company.
Monthly Income: Employee's salary.
Years at Company: Total years worked in the company.
Work-Life Balance: Rating of work-life balance (scale of 1-5).
Job Satisfaction: Employee's satisfaction level (scale of 1-5).
Attrition: Whether the employee left the company (Yes/No).

 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
     **Attrition Rate Analysis:**

Overall attrition rate: 15.3%
Higher attrition was observed in Sales & Customer Service roles.
Key Summary Statistics:

Monthly Income:
Average: $5,000
Insight: Employees earning below $4,000 have a higher risk of leaving.
Years at the Company:
Average: 5.2 years
Insight: High attrition is seen in employees with less than 2 years of tenure.
Work-Life Balance:
Average: 3.2 (out of 5)
Insight: Employees with low work-life balance (‚â§2) are more likely to leave.

**Correlation Insights:**
Job Satisfaction & Attrition (Correlation = -0.58): Lower job satisfaction significantly increases the likelihood of attrition.
Work-Life Balance & Attrition (Correlation = -0.47): Poor work-life balance is a strong indicator of turnover.
Salary & Attrition (Correlation = -0.30): Employees with lower salaries are more likely to leave.

**Machine Learning Analysis**
Model: Random Forest Classifier, Logistic Regression, and XGBoost.
Accuracy: 88.4% (Random Forest), 85.7% (Logistic Regression), 90.1% (XGBoost).

** Class Imbalance Challenge:**

Majority Class: Employees who stay.
Minority Class: Employees who leave (only 15% of the dataset).
Solution: Used SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to balance classes.
üìä Performance Metrics:

Precision: 0.84
Recall: 0.78
F1-score: 0.81

**Recommendations**
For Employee Retention:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Competitive Salaries & Benefits:

Adjust compensation based on market trends and employee performance.
Offer performance-based bonuses and equity incentives.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Work-Life Balance Initiatives:
Introduce remote work options and flexible schedules.
Provide mental health support and wellness programs.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Engagement & Job Satisfaction:
Conduct regular employee feedback surveys.
Offer mentorship programs and career growth opportunities.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Targeted Retention Strategies:
Focus on high-risk departments (Sales, Customer Support).
Provide extra incentives for employees with frequent travel.
5Ô∏è‚É£ Predictive Analytics for HR:
Implement AI-driven alerts for high-risk employees.
Use employee sentiment analysis from survey responses.
